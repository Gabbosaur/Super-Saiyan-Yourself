# Super Saiyan Yourself
Have you ever wanted to turn yourself into a Super Saiyan? I bet you do!

This project was born as an application of what I was studying and to satisfy our inner kid's desire.

You're welcome to contribute to any kind of improvement to the project! :)

Just reach me out on my dedicated [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vQAfHbMN).

## Installation

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gabbosaur/Super-Saiyan-Yourself.git
```

Open the project on VS Code and launch it with the extension Live Server.

## Usage
Once you run the web application, click on the START button and give access to the camera.

There are 3 poses to play with:
- Neutral: standing still with relaxed arms
- Initial: making an X with your forearms, this is the initial pose in order to gather energy to transform
- Aura burst: spread your arms like Goku when he's turning Super Saiyan

Border color indicators:
- Red: move a bit further from the camera in order detect the important keypoints (eyes, nose, shoulders, elbows, wrists and hips)
- Green: ready for poses
- Yellow: default color and triggered when in Aura burst state

## Contributing
